# `microtile-app`

A microscopic Tetris® inspired application, targeting the [BBC micro:bit v2](https://microbit.org/).
For the underlying engine, see [`microtile-engine`](https://github.com/90degs2infty/microtile-engine).

I'm enrolled in the 2023 edition of the [Making Embedded Systems course by Elecia White](https://classpert.com/classpertx/courses/making-embedded-systems/cohort).
This repository is part of my final project submission.

## Contribution

Since the aforementioned course is still running and this repository is part of the final project, I currently do not take any outside contributions.
This will change, once the course is over.

Nevertheless, please feel free to point out suggestions, improvements and alike anyway!
Thank you! :blush:
